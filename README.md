# Meditations

[This](https://alexlitel.github.io/meditations) is a little art experiment of generative aesthetic meditations inspired by the credit sequences of the TV show _Painting with John_. Leveraging multilayered CSS gradients and transitions, it is designed at one to be aesthetically complex and soothing -- the opposite of much of the rest of the internet we look at.
